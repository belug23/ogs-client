OGS Online-go.com Desktop Client

This OGS client actually the electron browser visiting the https://online-go.com site. It can remember the login status and create tray icon in the Desktop. 

Logically this electron project should also support for MacOS, but I don't have it, so haven't tried that.

#Setup

Node.js required

1. npm install
2. npm pack:electron

Setup files in electron_app/dist/
